# Heart Disease Data Exploration Project 

## Introduction 
This project serves to learn how to use tensor flow deep learning tools. I am using Kaggle's Heart Disease UCI data set as an example. This dataset has 14 attribute: 

* age (in years)
* sex
* chest pain type 
* resting blood pressing (in mmHg)
* serum cholestorl (in mg/dl)
* fasting blood sugar (whether it is >120 mg/dl)
* maximum heart rate 
* exercise induced angina 
* ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest 
* slope of peak exercise ST segment 
* number of major vessels colored by flouroscopy 
* thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
* target (0 or 1)
